            <h2>The Problems</h2>

            <p>
                From 2019 the CDC the leading cause of death was heart disease(659,041). In America a lot of people eat a lot of unhealthy foods and eat bigger portions which then be less active. The number of Americans who have become overweight has been rising. In
                America more than 1 in 3 American adults is now obese and also 1 in 3 Americans are overweight. Majority of people do not see the problem with being overweight but with being obese can lead to serious health problems such as Heart disease,
                Type 2 diabetes, High blood pressure, High Cholesterol levels, Stroke, Gallbladder Disease, Sleep Apnea, Breathing Problems, Arthritis and Depression and Anxiety The real problem that I noticed is that tv or anything public talks about
                getting fit and working out but the problem is they may say get fit but they do not talk about what to eat or what food is healthy to consume. I am not saying all food is bad but the majority of food is advertised is fast food or food
                that is fried or heavy in grease.

            <h2>Solutions</h2>

            <p>
                Before I say anything I want to first mentioned their is nothing wrong with eating ice cream or eating sweets within moderation. Anyway a solution to eating healthy is actually making sure you eat enough during the day. Being healthy does not mean that
                you have to get a gym membership I understand that a lot of people are under time restraints which is very reasonable, but should be more common is getting up and moving around instead of laying down for long periods of hours. Another
                solution is to limit tv I know that sounds like something a parent would say but when it comes to watching tv you are only just sitting for a couple of hours which isn't healthy but I am not talking about the people who do it for one day
                I am talking about the people who do it daily. With this pandemic staying at home has made us lazy because we have no where to go just make sure in any situation not to take the lazy path.

            <h2>Suggestions</h2>

            <p>
                Their are a lot of ways to be active. It does not take much to be active for example if you have a choice to make a home cooked meal or go out to eat at a fast food restaurant my suggestion would be to stay home and cook a nice home cooked meal. Another
                thing that I've seen this year is with DoorDash and Instakart, so instead of ordering your food or groceries online go out and go to the store to buy your groceries just you walking around the store is an exercise itself and limit yourself
                with Doordashing go out to the restaurant to get a little walking into your day. Any little exercise you do counts whether it's walking around your neighborhood or just simply going to run some errands. Also another suggestion is to go
                outside as often as possible to take in some sun and if you do take vitamins to help boost your energy to make you feel better and motivated.
