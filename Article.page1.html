        Why being healthy is important
    </h2>

    <p>Being healthy is something a lot of people take for granted. This article is by Medical News Today and it explains the importance of taking care of yourself and why health is cruel to your day to day life and if you want to know more the article does
        provide addition information on what being healthy helps other parts of your life like sleep and your mood etc. I found this article when I first started to workout because before I did not workout as much as I do now and before I was always tired
        and had no energy until I realized it was because I wasn't active. The second article is written by Carly Schuna and she talks about what things in your life are affected when you are living a healthy Life. </p>

    <h2>Why being overweight is harmful to yourself</h2>
    <p> Being overweight affects more than you think. You do not realize it but it is something that really common to overlook. The problem in today's world is people are trying to say it is healthy to be overweight but I am someone who follows facts not
        emotions and someone who use to be overweight I can say it is not healthy to be overweight and It had negative affects.
